Attribute info handling:
if store att_info with order (in a list):
    Hard to handle available atts.
if store att_info without order (in a dict):
    Impossible to convert file rows to dict.
Solution:
    [(att_name, att_values)]

Class info handling:
if only store num_classes:
    I will have no idea what the labels will be ('c1', 'c2', ...), until runtime.
    I need a SuffStat for each class.
    Impossible to associate each label with a suffstat.
